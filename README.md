## Welcome to the _charlotte zone_ !

üñ•Ô∏è Hello! I'm 22, former student at @univ-rennes1 (ISTIC) in Computer Science after a cycle of two years in _classe pr√©paratoires aux grandes √©coles_ 

üßÆ I work mainly in Theoretical Computer Science, in formal language theory, I'm only starting to learn it so my work is not very advanced, you can check [calc](https://github.com/coco33920/calc), [Baguette#](https://github.com/coco33920/ocaml-baguettesharp-interpreter) or [STARFinder](https://github.com/coco33920/STARFinder) for more information.

In February 2023 I started an internship at IRISA/INRIA Rennes, at the [PACAP Team](https://team.inria.fr/pacap/presentation/), where I worked on [OFast3D](https://project.inria.fr/ofast3d/). This internship ended in July 2023.
My end-of-study internship was in the [EPICURE Team](https://team.inria.fr/epicure/), where I worked on the [back-to-the-trees](https://back-to-the-trees.gitlabpages.inria.fr/plantinator/) project. This internship ended in July 2024.

I am now an IT specialist

### My Work
As I said above I work now in formal language theory, primarily in *OCaml* and *Rust* but also in *Scala* (which my University requires), I plan to learn Coq as I continue (and Haskell). I'm actively developing _Baguette#_ (read Baguette Sharp) which is an exotic language with a horrible syntax and where all instruction, basic library, keywords and separators are replaced by names of pastries (mainly French but I ran out of French pastries a while ago)

I love [calc](https://github.com/coco33920/calc) as well, which is a calculator programmed in Rust with a Pratt parser method. You can check it out, it's worth an eye :)

If you want to see more see my [cv (üá´üá∑)](https://github.com/coco33920/cv/blob/master/cv_2024.pdf) or [cv (üá¨üáß)](https://github.com/coco33920/cv/blob/master/cv_2024_en.pdf) 
coded in Typst: the modern replacement of LaTeX. I love how flexible and powerful Typst is you should check out their [website](https://typst.app) to become part of the #TypstFamily. I am a proud supporter of their work and one of the most prolific community contributors.
