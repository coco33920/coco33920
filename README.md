### Welcome to the _charlotte zone_ !

üñ•Ô∏è Hello! I'm 20 and a student at @univ-rennes1 (ISTIC) in Computer Science (second year) after a cycle of two years in _classe pr√©paratoires aux grandes √©coles_ 

üßÆ I work mainly in Theoretical Computer Science, in formal language theory, I'm only starting to learn it so my work is not very advanced, you can check Baguette# or STARFinder for more information

üåà She/her

üì´ I'm *always* available to chat or answer question, on  <a href="https://twitter.com/coco33920">Twitter</a>, by mail ( *contact@nwa2coco.fr* ), or Discord ( Charlotte#4078 ).

### My Work
As I said above I work now in formal language theory, primarly in *OCaml* but also in *Scala* (which my University requires for fourth semester), I plan to learn Coq as I continue (and Haskell). I'm actively developping _Baguette#_ (read Baguette Sharp) which is an exotic language with an horrible syntax and where all instruction, basic library, keywords and separators are replaced by name of pastries (mainly french one but I ran out of french pastries a while ago).

I'm also developping STARFinder which is a little project to learn Scala and its integration with Java, the language itself is dead simple it's a basic logic parser to find bus stops (and not stars ;))
