## Welcome to the _charlotte zone_ !

üñ•Ô∏è Hello! I'm 21 and a student at @univ-rennes1 (ISTIC) in Computer Science (third year) after a cycle of two years in _classe pr√©paratoires aux grandes √©coles_ 

üßÆ I work mainly in Theoretical Computer Science, in formal language theory, I'm only starting to learn it so my work is not very advanced, you can check [calc](https://github.com/coco33920/calc), [Baguette#](https://github.com/coco33920/ocaml-baguettesharp-interpreter) or [STARFinder](https://github.com/coco33920/STARFinder) for more information.

In february 2023 I started an internship at IRISA/INRIA Rennes, at the [PACAP Team](https://team.inria.fr/pacap/presentation/), where I worked on [OFast3D](https://project.inria.fr/ofast3d/). This internship ended in July 2023.

### My Work
As I said above I work now in formal language theory, primarly in *OCaml* and *Rust* but also in *Scala* (which my University requires), I plan to learn Coq as I continue (and Haskell). I'm actively developping _Baguette#_ (read Baguette Sharp) which is an exotic language with an horrible syntax and where all instruction, basic library, keywords and separators are replaced by name of pastries (mainly french one but I ran out of french pastries a while ago)

I love [calc](https://github.com/coco33920/calc) too which is a minimalistic calculator programmed in Rust with a Pratt parser method. You can check it out, it's really worth an eye :)

If you want to see more go see my [cv (fr)](https://github.com/coco33920/cv/blob/master/cv_2023.pdf) or [cv (en)](https://github.com/coco33920/cv/blob/master/cv_2023_en.pdf) 
coded in Typst: the modern replacement of LaTeX. I love how flexible and powerful Typst is you should check out their [website](https://typst.app) to become part of the #TypstFamily
